# Hotel-Reservation-App
### An interface to Airbnb to search for hotels and properties in any location across the world

Users can select Location, Check-in and Check-out date, Number of adults, children, pets and currency format (USD is the default currency) to search for properties across the world.
> Location, Check-in, Check-out and Number of Adults are required fields.

> If these fields are left black when clicked on "_Search_", users will be alerted.

> If Check-in or Check-out date is before "Today", users will be alerted.

> If Check-out date is before Check-in date, users will be alerted.

In return, they are presented with a list of properties matching their search criteria with property details like name, price, number of bed and baths, reviews, amenities, total capacity of the property etc.

Each hotel card will also have a "_View Images_" button to preview images of the property within this application and on clicking "_Reserve Now_" button, users will be taken to the respective property's page in **Airbnb** application for booking.
