# Hotel-Reservation-App
An interface to Airbnb to search for hotels in any location across the world
Users can select location, check-in and check-out date, number of adults and so on, to search for properties across the world.
In return, they are presented with a list of properties matching their search criteria with property details like name, price, number of bed and baths, reviews, amenities, total capacity of the property etc.
Each hotel card will also have a 'View Images" button to preview images of the property within this application and on clicking "Reserve Now" button, users will be taken to the respective property's page in Airbnb application for booking.
